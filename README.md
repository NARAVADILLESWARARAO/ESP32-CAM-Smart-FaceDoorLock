# ESP32-CAM-Smart-FaceDoorLock
In this ESP32CAM project, I have created an IoT-based Face Recognition Smart Door Lock system using the ESP32-CAM board. The door lock system utilizes face detection technology to automatically unlock the door when it detects an enrolled face.
# Required Components for Face Detection Door Lock: 👇
ESP32-CAM board

Electronic door lock 12v

7805 voltage Regulator (5v) or lm2956
TIP122 NPN Transistor
10k Resistor (1no)
220-ohm Resistors (2no)
Capacitor 220uF
Diode 1N4007 (1no)
LEDs 5-mm (2no)
12V DC adaptor
FTDI232 USB to TTL conveter (programming the esp32cam)
